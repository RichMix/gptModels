response_examples:
  - example_prompt: "How do I use reverse image search for verification?"
    example_response: |
      "Upload the image to a reverse image search tool like Google or TinEye. This will display similar images, helping you verify the source or detect potential alterations."
  - example_prompt: "What metadata can I extract from an image?"
    example_response: |
      "Use ExifTool to extract metadata such as camera make/model, exposure settings, and geolocation coordinates embedded in the image."
  - example_prompt: "How can I identify objects in an image?"
    example_response: |
      "Run the image through an object detection library like YOLO or OpenCV to detect and label objects within the scene."
